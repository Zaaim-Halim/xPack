# Expense Tracker

A small, modern desktop application for keeping track of what you spend, built
with JavaFX and SQLite — and the **reference application xPack is validated
against**.

It is two things at once:

1. **A real application.** Record expenses, file them under categories, and
   see where the month's money went on a dashboard.
2. **A living integration test for xPack.** It is packaged, installed,
   launched, updated, rolled back and uninstalled with xPack, and every one of
   those steps is checked by a script against a result the application makes
   observable.

The goal is not to show that Expense Tracker works with xPack. It is to show
that **xPack itself works** when it packages and maintains a real desktop
application. Why it exists, what it proves so far and what comes next are in
[BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md).

## What it does (1.0.0)

- **Dashboard:** this month's total, how many expenses, the top category,
  spending by category and the latest expenses.
- **Expenses:** add, edit and delete; sortable by date, description, category
  or amount; double-click or Enter to edit, Delete to remove.
- **Categories:** eight to start with; add your own, rename, recolour; a
  category still holding expenses cannot be deleted, so no expense is ever lost
  with it.
- **Your data stays yours:** everything is in one SQLite file outside the
  installation, so updating or uninstalling the application never touches it.

Amounts are stored in whole cents, never as floating-point numbers, so totals
are exact.

## Where the data lives

| Platform | Default |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Expense Tracker/expenses.db` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Expense Tracker\expenses.db` |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/expense-tracker/expenses.db`, or `~/.local/share/expense-tracker/` |

`--data-dir=DIR` keeps it somewhere else.

## Command line

```text
expense-tracker [--data-dir=DIR] [COMMAND]

With no command, opens the application.

  --version                         print the version and exit
  --status                          print where the data is and what it holds
  --add DESCRIPTION AMOUNT CATEGORY add an expense dated today
  --help                            show this help
```

The commands never start the graphical toolkit, so they work with no display.
That is how the validation scripts drive the installed application. `--status`
prints one `key=value` per line:

```text
version=1.0.0
java.version=21.0.8
java.home=…/io.xpack.examples.expensetracker/versions/1.0.0/runtime
data.dir=…
database=…/expenses.db
schema=1
xpack.application.dir=…/io.xpack.examples.expensetracker
expenses=2
total=15.90
```

## Building and running

Needs a JDK 21 with `jlink`, Maven, xPack's binaries, and the Maven plugin
installed locally:

```sh
# From the repository root: xPack itself, and its Maven plugin.
cargo build --release --workspace
(cd integrations/maven && mvn install)

# A signing key for trying it out, kept outside the repository.
target/release/xpack keygen --out ~/xpack-demo-keys/signing.json

# Build, install into target/xpack/run and start it, in one go.
cd examples/expense-tracker
mvn package io.xpack:xpack-maven-plugin:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT:run \
  -Dxpack.home=../../target/release -Dxpack.key=$HOME/xpack-demo-keys/signing.json
```

`mvn package` alone produces the signed package in `target/xpack/dist`; add the
plugin's `installer` goal for the installer a user runs.

JavaFX is on the class path rather than the module path, which keeps it working
with no change to the Maven plugin. JavaFX notes this on start with an
"Unsupported JavaFX configuration" line; it is expected and harmless.

## Validating xPack

```sh
examples/expense-tracker/validation/validate-install.sh
```

Builds the application with the Maven plugin, installs it with its own
installer in a scratch directory with its own `HOME` and key, and checks, one
line each:

- the plugin builds a signed package and an installer, and the package verifies
- the installer installs silently, and the launcher is in place
- the application starts through the launcher, and its arguments reach it
- it runs on the bundled Java, not the machine's
- xPack tells it where it is installed
- the user's data is written outside the installation
- the version reports its own start, so xPack records it as healthy
- the uninstaller removes the application and its desktop entry
- the user's data survives the uninstall

Nothing outside the scratch directory is touched; `KEEP=1` keeps it for
inspection.

## Reviewing the look

```sh
java -cp "target/classes:$(cat target/cp.txt)" com.example.expensetracker.Main --render=/tmp/screens
```

Draws every screen, with sample data in a throwaway database, into PNG files:
the three pages, their empty states and the dialogs. The class path file comes
from `mvn dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=target/cp.txt
-Dmdep.includeScope=runtime`.
